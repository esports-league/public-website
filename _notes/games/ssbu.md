Adapted from the SmashBoards ruleset Meta - SSBU Competitive Ruleset Discussion | Smashboards and the California Ultimate Recommended Ruleset California Ultimate Recommended Ruleset - Google Docs 

Tournament sets are the best of 3 games. It is recommended that Super Smash Bros Ultimate (“Smash”) is limited to players in year 9+ due to occasional violence and/or inappropriate character design. 

Games are played with no DLC permitted. 

Set Procedure: 

Players select their characters. Either player may elect to do Double Blind Character Selection 

Use Starter Stage Striking to determine the first stage 

The players play the first game of the set 

Winning player of the preceding game strikes 2 stages (when applicable). The losing player of the preceding game picks a stage for the next game 

The winning player of the preceding game may choose to change characters. 

The losing player of the preceding game may choose to change characters. 

The next game is played. 

Repeat Steps 4 through 8 for all subsequent games until the set is complete.

If time runs out, the winner is first determined by how many stocks remain, and then by the percentage after time is up. 

If both stock and percentage are the same, or a game ends in both players losing their last stock at the same time, then a tiebreaker is played, which consists of a 1 stock and 3 minute match with the same characters and the same stage. 

Playable characters: 

All characters are permitted as playable fighters.  

Miis are permitted but swapping loadouts mid-set is banned. If Miis are allowed to switch specials, this is treated as fully changing characters. 

Universal starters: 

The following stages should be used as starter stages in any match:  

Battlefield and most battlefield form stages 

Final Destination and most Ω form stages 

Pokémon Stadium 2 / Small Battlefield 

Smashville 

Per many competitive ruleset conventions, the following stages are banned: 

Hanenbow 

Dream Land GB

Super Mario Maker

Gamer 

Dave’s Stupid Rule (DSR)  

In CHISEL tournaments, DSR is in place to prevent unfair adavantages by playing the same stages multiple times in a set. DSR states a player cannot pick the last stage they won on during a set.  

Example set between Player A and Player B 

Match 1: Player A wins on Battlefield 

Match 2: Player A wins on Lylat Cruise 

Match 3: Player B wins on Final Destination. 

Match 4: Player A can now choose to play on Battlefield, but not on Lylat Cruise (their most recent victory).  

Exceptions to the rule: if both parties agree to a stage regardless of legality, then it can be played. 

Stalling/Disqualification: 

Stalling, or intentionally making the game unplayable, is banned and at the discretion of tournament staff. Stalling includes but is not limited to becoming invisible, continuing infinites past 300%, and reaching a position that your opponent can never reach you. Stalling will result in a forfeit of the game for the player that initiated the action.
