What are esports? How do they affect our students, in both the short and long term?

> Simply put, esports are video games that are played in a highly organized competitive environment. These games can range from popular, team-oriented multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs), to single player first person shooters, to survival battle royales, to virtual reconstructions of physical sports.
> *Harvard International Review, April 2020*

>Recent studies suggest there is an association between greater mental resilience and positive stress-coping processes in traditional sports and competitive esports athletes.
> *Murdoch University*

It's time to start treating esports in the same way we consider 'traditional' sports. The top earning esports player in the world, Johan “N0tail” Sundstein, earned nearly $7 million by 2021. He started playing the game that would make his career when he was 15.

## Why Nintendo Switch? 

The Nintendo Switch console is relatively low-priced compared to other consoles (e.g. Playstation, Xbox) and provides for an easier (and more affordable) starting point than creating a dedicated gaming computer suite. Controllers are child-friendly and easy to replace, particularly with lower-priced alternatives. Games on Nintendo Switch are often more family-friendly, and the Nintendo Online system allows for easy competition across schools and, indeed, across countries.

## Connecting esports to the IB Learner Profile 

Through taking part in esports, students of all ages develop their IB learner attributes. Through esports training and competitions, students will become: 
- **inquirers** about the world around them, researching tactics and professional gameplay stats both independently and with their teammates, using data to improve and inform decisions, considering strategies and taking part in complex problem-solving activities;  
- **knowledgeable** about taking care mental and physical health when gaming, tactics and techniques for specific games, the opportunities esports can provide, the esports industry as a whole;  
- **thinkers** when considering critically their team strategy, showing initiative when choosing competitions to enter (or competitors to put forward where needed), being creative in their approach to challenges, managing time and resources appropriately;  
- **principled** in the way they play with honesty and integrity, respect others, and have positive team spirit in approach to both victory and defeat;  
- **open-minded** when considering the needs of others around them and understanding new tactics and approaches they may not have initially considered, when approaching all competitors with the same attitude regardless of gender, sexuality, disability, race, religion, or any other personal characteristics;  
- **caring** for their teammates and opponents, and caring for themselves in learning how to look after their physical and mental wellbeing;  

- **risk-takers** when trying new tactics that may or may not result in success, when exploring new ideas and innovative strategies, when setting, preparing for, and accomplishing goals;  
- **balanced** in ensuring that they balance gaming time with outdoor entertainment and face-to-face socialization, learning about how professional esports leagues ensure the same;  
- **reflective** with themselves and their teammates when viewing gameplay footage and reviewing past games to understand how and where they can improve for the future, when considering team strengths and weaknesses and how these can be improved upon or taken advantage of during competition, when understanding when it is best to step away from a game entirely.
