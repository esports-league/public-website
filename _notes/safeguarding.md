title: Safeguarding
---

All participants should refer to each other by gamertag or by school name, except where teachers may prefer to be referred to in a professional manner. 

During a competition, all involved schools must have at least one named adult present for the entirety of the match. This adult will be the point of contact for any safeguarding issues and should be visible on camera at all times. 

Participating schools are responsible for the safeguarding of their own students.  CHISEL takes no responsibility for any issues that may arise as a result of involvement in CHISEL tournaments. 

Games will be recorded on Teams and recordings stored by the host school for a minimum of thirty (30) days. Copies of the recording should be presentable on request by any member of CHISEL or competing schools. Any concerns should be raised prior to the end of the thirty-day period. This includes concerns of rule breaking, cheating, inappropriate conduct, or other safeguarding concerns.
