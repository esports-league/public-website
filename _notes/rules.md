title: Rules and regulations
---

Our philosophy: 

Participation in esports is not solely focused on developing abilities in specific games, but on strategies to support mental and physical wellbeing in all areas of life.  

The satisfaction at the end of the competition comes from knowing you've done your best and that important learning experiences can come from participating, losing or winning.  

An ethic  of  fair  play  should  be  a  cultural  norm  in  all  CHISEL competitions.  A 'Winning at all costs' approach is not appropriate in a tournament.  

Rules should  be  viewed  as  an  important  part  of  maintaining  fairness  in  a competition and have been developed to align with international rulesets.  Coaches and  players  should  not  look  to  exploit  rules,  but  rather always play within the spirit of the rule.  

We  treat  everyone  with  respect.  This  includes  our  own  team  members,  the opponents, officials, and spectators. We do not permit any discrimination based on sexuality, gender, religion, ethnicity, race, or any other protected characteristic. 

Team makeup 

Teams playing in fixtures are by nature limited to game capacity. Suggested tournament formats are provided later in this document for best practice in games following international competition standards. Schools may wish to have a larger team from which they can pull specific students to play in fixtures; this is acceptable and common practice across the group. 

Member schools should encourage mixed-gender teams where possible. However, to encourage uptake of female-identifying students in esports, female-only competitions are permitted. This should be determined on a school level in discussions prior to each competition. 

A student who represents a school in an CHISEL event must be a full-time enrolled member of that school. 

Participation in CHISEL is limited to high school and middle school students (Year 7+) who are below the maximum age limit of 19 years of age.

Be nice, have fun. 

Fixtures will use Microsoft Teams as the primary form of communication, although this can be adjusted as long as participating schools agree ahead of time. 

A team will be instantly disqualified in cases of acts of violence, aggression, discrimination (including but not limited to racial, religious, sexual orientation, gender), tampering with consoles.  

Rage-quitting, leaving for no reason, or showing lack of effort will result in an automatic loss for the team for that game. Regular breaches may result in disqualification from the season. 

Gamertags may include players’ first names and schools, but further inclusion of personal information is not permitted. Inappropriate language in gamertags is cause for instant disqualification. 

Participating schools are responsible for technical issues including hardware, software, and connectivity issues. We recommend a hard-wired connection where possible. 

If games have significant lag or loading issues, the game may be reset or rescheduled only if both schools consent. 

Teams must be present on the Teams call at least five minutes prior to the scheduled start time of the game to give both sides enough time to deal with any technical issues. If a team is not ready to play by the final start time, they will be required to start anyway or forfeit. 

Teams are encouraged to take a five minute screen break between each game, or at a minimum of every fifteen minutes. 

Disputes should be settled within 30 days of gameplay – this includes any issues around incorrect settings, match fixing, automating in-game actions, modifying in any way beyond vanilla settings, inappropriate behaviour or gamertags. 

Examples of unfair play that is not permitted: 

Collusion (e.g., any agreement between two or more Teams or Players on different Teams to pre-determine the outcome of a fixture), Match fixing, bribing a referee or Match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any Game, Match, or Tournament. 

Using any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage. 

Using macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions. 

Intentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by the game developer in order to gain a competitive advantage. Note that for the purposes of CHISEL, shortcuts in Mario Kart are not considered bugs or glitches and are expressly permitted.
