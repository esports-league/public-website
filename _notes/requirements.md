  - As of September 2023, we permit the use of third-party controllers (both joy-con and pro-style controllers) to support CHISEL player in keeping costs reduced.
- Nintendo online account – this is required to support online play and is paid via annual or monthly subscription 
- Nintendo Switch games for 2023-24 – note that no DLC is permitted in CHISEL games.
  - Mario Kart 8  
  - Super Smash Bros
  - Rocket League

## Optional

You may also wish to purchase a copy of the following games games for termly friendly matches, although this is entirely optional: 

- Overcooked
- Just Dance

*this list is often altered by our members who arrange friendlies by themselves, so feel free to decide on your own games in this category!*

### A note for members based in China

Many of our members have had issues in the past with ping speed and/or online connections being slow when playing Nintendo online. This is particularly prevalent in Super Smash Bros which requires a fast connection for effective game play. If you would like to play a test match prior to a fixture in order to test your connection, the CHISEL team would be more than happy to join you! We also have a number of recommendations for additional hardware that may support you in getting a better connection; just get in touch.
