title: How to join us
---

Itâ€™s easy! We welcome participation from any international schools in China (or in the greater Asia region). Our language of communication is English, and we use a mixture of email, WeChat, and Discord to chat, push out notices and prepare for fixtures.  

We accept applications for involvement on a rolling basis, however we do ask that if you wish to get involved in fixtures that you ensure your team is available for all three fixtures for any given season.

If you would like to know more or want to get involved, please send an expression of interest by filling in this form, and we will be in touch with you as soon as possible.
