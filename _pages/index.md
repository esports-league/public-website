# Welcome! ðŸŽ®

We are a collection of international schools in China who wanted to provide our students with a fun and safe environment to play games competitively.

Fixtures take place on scheduled Tuesdays after school and additional â€˜friendliesâ€™ take place throughout the year. There are nine scheduled fixtures in total across the 2023-24 school year, covering three separate seasons (Mario Kart 8, Super Smash Bros, Rocket League). We may also offer an ongoing Minecraft Speedrun competition towards the end of the academic year if interest is high enough.  

We welcome the input of all participating CHISEL schools in the organization of fixtures and events and take pride in our collaborative nature, including working together to plan the yearâ€™s events ahead of time once schools have confirmed their annual calendars.
